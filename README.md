# Overview
The project we are working with is associated with building a model with a strong and efficient
classifier that will be able to label data with very good accuracy. Most of the traditional machine
learning algorithms out there find it difficult to consistently classify groups with great accuracy.
As a result, pattern classification becomes a long and tedious process.
The model that we have worked on aims to work on this and work on a model that provides
greater accuracy on a more consistent basis. For this, we have implemented Active Learning for
identifying patterns within certain data and classifying them according to our trained model.

# Problem Statement
The model that is being created by us deals with three datasets primarily, namely the Wine
Dataset, the Iris Dataset and the Breast Cancer Dataset. There are a lot of situations in real life
where critical tasks are being carried out by Machine Learning algorithms. Some of these
situations require the algorithm in the systems to be extremely accurate, efficient and fast. For
instance, if we take one of the datasets that we have worked on, Breast Cancer, is one of the
very prominent forms of Cancer today. The effect and fatality of Cancer is already known to
mankind. If not found at the early stages, it can have devastating effects on a human. Thus, it is
extremely important to not only find it an an early stage, but also find out the details quickly and
accurately. There is not a lot of room for error in this case, so there needs to be a system that
finds out the form of cancer accurately, but also relatively quickly. There are already rapid
advancements and evolution in the systems that are used to classify these forms of data to make
them more efficient. The main problem of these kinds of critical issues is accuracy and time.
The model that we are working on aims at solving this very important problem. Previously, we
have worked on creating an Active Learning Classifier with the help of two prominent
algorithms used in traditional Machine Learning, namely the K-Nearest Neighbour Classifier and
the K-Means Clustering Algorithm. We are aiming to improve on our model at multiple fronts
and have decided to go forward with the Support Vector Machine as our base training model for
the Active Learning Algorithm.
